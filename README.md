Overview
========

This repository contains the sources for Sankey diagrams highlighting elements of the Portola Valley budget. This is an *unofficial* repository for illustrative purposes.  The numbers here have been copied by hand as best possible, but there is a chance that there are typos or other errors.  The official budget is definitive - if you have detailed questions about the budget, you can find them in the budget book.
