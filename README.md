Overview
========

This repository contains the sources for Sankey diagrams highlighting elements of the Portola Valley budget. This is an *unofficial* repository for illustrative purposes.  The numbers here have been copied by hand as best possible, but there is a chance that there are typos or other errors.  The official budget is definitive - if you have detailed questions about the budget, you can find them in the budget book.

Editing
-------

The source files only are in this repository. To generate diagrams, you must use the website at https://sankeymatic.com/build/ and copy/paste the code from these files into the input field.  Each file will give some instructions in comments at the top indicating some useful settings for that file (size, alignment, etc).

Output
------

The output from these files will generally be saved as SVG and then converted to PDF, with both the SVG and PDF versions archived here, though these are not necessarily fully updated all the time at this point:
